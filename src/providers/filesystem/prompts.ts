Question: ${question}
Question Date: ${questionDate || "Not specified"}

Retrieved Memory Files:
${retrievedContext}

**Understanding the Context:**
The context above contains structured memory extractions from conversations (similar to Claude Code's MEMORY.md files). Each memory file contains categorized information: key facts, preferences, events with dates, relationships, and decisions.

**How to Answer:**
1. Scan the memory files for facts, events, and preferences relevant to the question
2. Pay attention to dates in the Events sections for temporal reasoning
3. Cross-reference facts across multiple memory files if needed
4. For time-based questions, calculate relative dates using the event dates and the question date
5. Use the structured categories (Key Facts, Preferences, Events, Relationships) to locate information quickly

Instructions:
- Base your answer ONLY on the provided memory files
- The memories contain curated, extracted facts -- look for direct matches to the question
- If the memories contain enough information, provide a clear, concise answer
- If the memories do not contain enough information, respond with "I don't know"
- Pay attention to temporal context for time-based questions
